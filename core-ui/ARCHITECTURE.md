## The model in one paragraph

Every page is **server-rendered (SSR)** on first request — full HTML, full
data, no skeleton, no client-side data fetch on initial load. The browser
receives the rendered page and `runtime.js` **hydrates** the existing DOM:
attaches event listeners, signal bindings, SSE streams. After hydration,
**page-to-page navigation is client-side** (Angular-router style: pushState,
partial fetch, swap content, with cache so back is instant — no hard
refreshes). **Interactions that change state inside the current page are
handled by islands**: a click triggers an RPC to the server-side island
handler, which returns the updated island HTML; the runtime swaps just
that island's content. The rest of the page stays put. **Server-pushed
updates** (e.g. another user changed something) flow through signals + SSE
to update bound DOM nodes without any client action.

---

## The four scenarios

| Scenario | What runs | What's on the wire |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial load** of any URL | Full SSR via `framework/uihost` → `app.RenderPage` → `Screen.Load(ctx)` → `Screen.Render()` | One HTML response with everything inline |
| **Page → page navigation** (`/a` → `/b`) | Client-side router intercepts `<a>` click, fetches partial via `X-Gofastr-Navigate: 1`, swaps `<main>`, caches the previous page for instant back | One small partial HTML response (just the screen content); no full chrome re-fetch |
| **In-page state change** (sort, paginate, expand a row, open a tab) | Click on an island element → RPC to the island's handler → server returns new island HTML → runtime swaps just the island's slot | One small RPC response with the changed island HTML |
| **Server-pushed update** (background event, another user's action) | Server-side signal update → SSE event → runtime updates `[data-fui-signal="…"]` nodes | SSE frames over a single long-lived connection |

**Forms and mutations** follow the in-page pattern: POST to the island's
RPC handler, response carries the new island HTML.

## What is an island?

An island is a **server-rendered, server-driven component** with its own
RPC endpoints and (optionally) signal bindings. It owns:

1. Its rendered HTML (SSR).
2. Its server-side state (in memory or DB).
3. Its update logic (handlers that re-render and respond).

Pagination is an island. A sortable table is an island. A "favorite" toggle
on a card is an island. A page header that needs to react to user-scope
changes is an island. **Inline content that never changes** (a static
heading, a piece of marketing copy, a footer) is **not** an island — it's
just rendered HTML.

The framework primitives live in:

- `core-ui/widget` — the builder API (`widget.New(name).Mount(...).Slot(...).Signal(...).RPC(...).RPCWithSignal(...)`)
- `core-ui/island` — the runtime-side island manager (registration, SSE push, slot lookup)
- `core-ui/signal` — reactive state values that trigger SSE pushes
- `core-ui/runtime/runtime.js` — the client-side hydration runtime

---

## Runtime primitives (the wiring)

The runtime understands a small set of `data-fui-*` attributes on the
hydrated DOM. **You don't write JavaScript** — you compose these on the
server side and the runtime does the work.

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data-fui-rpc="<path>"` | Click / form-submit fires a request to `<path>` |
| `data-fui-rpc-method="GET\|POST\|…"` | HTTP method (default POST) |
| `data-fui-rpc-signal="<name>"` | The response body is treated as a signal value and broadcast to bound nodes |
| `data-fui-rpc-close` | Containing widget closes on 2xx |
| `data-fui-rpc-reset` | Containing form resets on 2xx |
| `data-fui-signal="<name>"` | This node's content/attribute updates when the named signal changes |
| `data-fui-signal-mode="text\|html\|attr"` | How to apply the signal value (default `text`) |
| `data-fui-signal-attr="<attr>"` | Attribute name when mode is `attr` |
| `data-fui-open="<widget-name>"` | Click opens a registered widget surface |
| `data-fui-push-state="<path>"` | After the RPC succeeds, apply this URL via `history.pushState` (no re-fetch). Useful when the button knows the canonical URL ahead of time (e.g. pagination button "page 3" → `data-fui-push-state="?p=3"`). Server-supplied `X-Gofastr-Push-State` header takes precedence. |
| `data-fui-confirm="<message>"` | Pre-flight `window.confirm(<message>)` before firing the RPC. Cancel aborts. Use for destructive actions (delete, revoke). |
| `data-fui-rpc-trigger="input"` | On a `<form data-fui-rpc=…>`, dispatch the RPC on every `input` event from any control inside, after a debounce window. |
| `data-fui-rpc-debounce-ms="<ms>"` | Debounce window for `data-fui-rpc-trigger="input"`. Default 250. |

**Response headers the runtime understands:**

| Header | Effect |
|---|---|
| `X-Gofastr-Push-State: <path>` | Apply via `history.pushState` after the RPC succeeds (URL update without re-fetch) |
| `X-Gofastr-Partial: true` | Body is a screen-partial (used by the cross-page nav path) |
| `X-Gofastr-Title: <text>` | Update `document.title` after partial swap |

**The flow for an in-page update** (e.g. clicking "page 2" on a pagination island):

```
[click]
  → button has data-fui-rpc="/island/customers/page" data-fui-rpc-method="POST" data-fui-rpc-signal="customers-rows"
  → runtime POSTs {"page": 2}
  → server handler computes new rows, renders HTML, returns it
  → runtime treats the response body as the new value of signal "customers-rows"
  → every node with data-fui-signal="customers-rows" data-fui-signal-mode="html" gets innerHTML replaced
  → no URL change, no <main> swap, no other DOM touched
```

## The three failure modes (do not repeat)

These are the misreadings of the model that have already cost rework.
Future agents: **if you find yourself doing one of these, stop and re-read this doc.**

### Failure 1: "Just intercept all link clicks for SPA"
> Symptom: every `<a href>` is hijacked by the runtime to do partial fetches.

That breaks the model for two reasons:
- **State-change interactions** like pagination should NOT be `<a href="?p=2">` links at all. They are island RPCs. The fact that I built pagination as a route-changing link is the root cause; "fixing" the link interception only papered over it.
- **Cross-page navigation** (a real `/a` → `/b`) IS supposed to be intercepted (Angular-router style with cache). Don't disable that to "fix" pagination — pagination wasn't a route in the first place.

### Failure 2: "Make every interaction a server round-trip via full nav"
> Symptom: clicking a sort header reloads the entire page.

That's a hard refresh. The model rules it out for in-page state. Use an
island RPC.

### Failure 3: "Make every interaction client-only after hydration"
> Symptom: pagination only works for datasets that fit in one render; the
> client manages pagination state in JS.

That's a different model (Stimulus-style). It conflicts with "islands are
server-driven" and "the server is the source of truth". For datasets
larger than first paint it just breaks. Use an island RPC and let the
server do the math.

---

## Why this model

- **Stability**: islands are stateless per-request HTTP. RPC is easy to
  retry, easy to log, easy to observe. SSE handles only push (no
  user-action-via-SSE), so connection-pool concerns stay manageable.
- **Scalability**: HTTP/2 multiplexes RPCs; a paginating user fires ~1
  request per click. SSE per session is one long-lived connection only
  for the genuine push channel — it is NOT how user actions reach the
  server. Mixing the two is fine; do not collapse them.
- **Server is source of truth**: pagination math, sort comparators,
  filtering rules, validation — all live in Go. The client never
  re-implements them. JS code shipped to the browser stays small and
  generic (the runtime is a few hundred lines of vanilla JS).
- **Hydration on SSR**: the first paint is a fully-rendered, accessible,
  scrape-able HTML document. Clients without JS get the same content,
  just without the interactivity layer. SEO + accessibility come for free.
- **No hard refreshes**: cross-page nav swaps content; in-page nav swaps
  islands. The runtime stays loaded; signals/SSE/cache survive.

## Recipes

### How to build a page

1. Implement `Screen` (`Render() render.HTML`, optionally `Load(ctx)` and `SetParams`).
2. Inside Render, compose `core-ui/elements` + `framework/ui` semantic components.
3. Anything that changes state in response to a user action → wrap it in
   an **island** (see below).
4. Register on the app router.

### How to build an island

1. Define a `widget.Definition` via the builder:
   ```go
   def := widget.New("customer-list").
       Slot("rows", &CustomerListRows{State: …}).
       RPCWithSignal("POST", "/islands/customers/page", pageHandler, "customer-list-rows")
   ```
2. The slot's component renders the current state. The handler reads
   request data, mutates state, returns the new HTML.
3. The runtime sees `data-fui-rpc="/islands/customers/page"` on the
   pagination button and `data-fui-signal="customer-list-rows"` with
   mode=html on the rows wrapper. Click → RPC → response → swap.
4. No `<a href>`. No URL change unless you opt into deep-linking via
   `pushState` from the handler's response (still no full reload).

### URL params are the source of truth

This is non-negotiable. Every island state that you want to be
**refreshable, shareable, bookmarkable, or back-button-able** must
round-trip through the URL. Refresh = same view. Share-link = same
view. Browser-back = previous view.

The flow:

1. **Initial load** (`/customers?p=2`):
   `Screen.Load(ctx)` reads `app.QueryFromContext(ctx).Get("p")` and
   pre-builds the island in its page-2 state. SSR ships fully-rendered
   page 2. The user can refresh and get exactly this — no JS required.

2. **Click "page 3" inside the island**:
   - The button is `data-fui-rpc="/islands/customers/page" data-fui-rpc-method="POST"`.
   - The RPC handler reads `{"page": 3}`, mutates server-side state,
     renders the new rows, and returns the HTML.
   - **The handler also returns an `X-Gofastr-Push-State: ?p=3` header.**
     The runtime applies it via `history.pushState` — URL becomes
     `?p=3` — but **does not** trigger a fetch. Just URL update + island swap.
   - Result: URL and DOM are now consistent. Bookmark works. Share works.

3. **Browser back**:
   - `popstate` fires with the previous URL (`?p=2`).
   - The runtime fetches the screen partial for the new URL via
     `X-Gofastr-Navigate: 1` (the same flow as cross-page nav) and
     swaps `<main>`. The screen's `Load(ctx)` reads `?p=2` again, the
     island is re-rendered server-side at page 2, partial response
     comes back, runtime swaps. The cache makes typical back-stack
     transitions feel instant.
   - This means popstate triggers a full screen-partial re-fetch, not
     a per-island patch. It's coarser than the click path but it's
     simpler and correct — and it's still way cheaper than a hard
     reload.

4. **Refresh / share / bookmark**: trivially correct because step 1
   handles the case.

This is "URL as the canonical state, RPC for the fast path, partial
re-fetch for popstate". You do not need to re-implement state in JS.
You do not need to teach the runtime about pagination. The runtime
just knows: *RPC response can carry a `pushState` header; popstate
triggers a screen-partial fetch.*

## Hard rules

1. **Never** treat in-page state changes as routes. No `<a href="?p=2">` for pagination.
2. **Never** re-implement pagination/sort/filter logic in JS. Server-side, always.
3. **Never** make user-action-driven updates flow through SSE. SSE is for server-pushed updates only. RPC is for user-initiated updates.
4. **Never** introduce a hard refresh as a fix. If you find yourself doing `location.href = …`, stop.
5. **Never** add new `data-fui-*` attributes without updating this doc and the runtime test suite.
6. **Always** start with `Screen.Load(ctx)` reading initial state (route params, query) and SSR-ing the first paint correctly.
7. **Always** prefer composing existing widget/preset shortcuts over building a new island from scratch.
